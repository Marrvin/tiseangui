#Instructions to make TiseanGUI work on MS Windows.

= Introduction =

This are a collection of tips to allow users of tiseanGUI to work under Windows. This instructions apply to Windows XP, the os in which it has been tested. 

= Installation of Python =

The installation on Windows of python is quite simple, you only have to use the Windows Installer provided in the python website:

http://www.python.org/download/

= Installation of GTK, Glade and PyGTK =

This instructions are for Windows XP workstations who hasn't have any previous installation of GTK+. 

The best way to install pygtk, is to follow its original guide on http://www.pygtk.org/downloads.html

The main problem with this guide is the recommendation of use of the GTK+ Bundle, which doesn't have libglade and Glade3 support, which is needed for tiseangui.

Luckily, the Glade Project has installers for windows that include all the binaries also with a GTK+.
http://glade.gnome.org/download.html

We are currently testing it with the following package:
http://ftp.gnome.org/pub/GNOME/binaries/win32/glade3/3.6/glade3-3.6.7-with-GTK+.exe

After installing GTK+ with Glade Support, you have to install the following pyCairo, pyGObjext, pyGTK from the pygtk downloads: http://www.pygtk.org/downloads.html

For any other doubts about setting up your pygtk environment you should read the following entry of the pygtk faq:

= Subprocess Module Support on Windows =

tiseangui also uses the subprocess module on windows and as it is stated in the PEP 324 (http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0324) it is necessary to install Mark Hammonds Windows Extensions to make it work.
The extensions can be found in https://sourceforge.net/projects/pywin32/
